Using this script uses a lot of resources since it fetches all your documents!
An example of OK usage is running this once every evening to get a list of
tasks you completed on that day. An example of bad usage is running it in your
bash prompt. Improper usage may result in disabling your API access or even
terminating your Marvin account. Don't worry, we'll give you a warning first
(via your Marvin email address), but please do be careful for the sake of other
users.
